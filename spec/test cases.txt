JUnit is supposed to be used, in order to test all Java Code. 
A detailed description can be found at junit.org

The functionalities that need to be tested are:

- Opening a SCAD-file 
- Closing a SCAD-file
- Exporting the result of the analysis
- Detection of warning and errors
	- All implemented warnings and errors should be covered
- Computing of "Parts Documentation" values
- Changing settings
- Autorefreshment of analysis result once code changed

Furthermore some functionality needs to be tested manually:

- Switching tabs (Code Analysis - Parts Documentation)
- Pressing the buttons
- Loading bar during analysis
- Starting/Closing the programm
- Full Screen mode
