** Brainstorming about the ToDos ***
(will be refined later on)

- Deciding on the logo
- Decide on who is in the static-team and who is in the docu-team
- Investigate FindBugs, PMD, Checkstyle, etc.
- Java with JavaFX
- What editor-library to use
- GUI-Prototype
- Define exact javadoc-like comment format (properties of a module)
- Define documentation export formats (e.g. PDF, HTML, XLS, CSV)
- Think about docu export intermediate format, e. g. as XML
- Docu consistency check (do the defined properties fit to the used properties)
- Sophisticated properties (calculated or combined values of properties)
- Only english gui, but all language string externalized
- Quality assurance: Review between the two subteams at the end of each sprint
- Unittesting: automated JUnit-Tests
- Define a Dictionary of Term (e.g. "checker")
- Every issue should have a single test case
- Configuration of Code Analysis Categories
- Define file format for configuration
- Syntax for supressing warnings (like @supressWarning in Java)
- Systemtest-Plan
- Custom Rules (Format/How do other tools do this?)
- Manual only as GitHub-Wiki
- Investigate what Parser to use
- Search for OpenSCAD-Language definitions
- Technical Design: Separate GUI-parts totally from command-line-version
- Investigate for a Text-Editor-Library (Code editiing with OpenSCAD-Syntax)
- Usability-Check
- Investigate Javadoc and try to find out which part could be implemented in a similar way
- Offer jar-File with OS-specific scripts
- Think about the target group (who will use the tool?)
- Create a test corpus from existing SCAD-files
- Description manual for issues
- Icons of Buttons etc.
- Buttons: Open Project, Close Project, Refresh Analyze,
- After opening a project, the analyzie is automatically started
- Deciding Licencing Options
