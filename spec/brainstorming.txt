** Brainstorming about the ToDos ***
(unrevised, unreviewed, unsorted -> will be refined later on)

- Only english gui, but all language string externalized
- Quality assurance: Review between the two subteams at the end of each sprint
- Unittesting: automated JUnit-Tests with code coverage measurement
- Every issue should have a single test case
- Define file format for configuration
- Custom Rules (Format/How do other tools do this?)
